# VectorCommitment

Implementation of Vector Commitment based on CDH<sup>1</sup>.

A vector commitment lets you commit once to an entire vector m and later open just one position i with a short proof that verifies against the original commitment.

### Requirements
Charm-Crypto v.0.50 (https://github.com/JHUISI/charm)

## Usage
A simple class-based API is provided in `vector_commitment_cdh.py`:

```python
from vector_commitment_cdh import VectorCommitmentCDH

vc = VectorCommitmentCDH('SS512')

m = [1, 2, 3]
_, h_vec, h_mat = vc.key_gen(len(m))

c = vc.commit(m, h_vec)
proof_i = vc.open(0, m, h_mat)
assert vc.verify(c, m[0], 0, proof_i, h_vec)
```

For backward compatibility, the legacy functions `key_gen`, `commit`, `open`, and `verify` remain available at module level and delegate to the class implementation.

## API
- VectorCommitmentCDH.key_gen(q) -> (z, h_vec, h_mat)
- VectorCommitmentCDH.commit(m, h_vec) -> commitment
- VectorCommitmentCDH.open(i, m, h_mat) -> proof for index i
- VectorCommitmentCDH.verify(c, m_i, i, proof, h_vec) -> bool

## Disclaimer
This is a research-grade implementation, meant for experimentation and educational use.
Not suitable for production deployment.
